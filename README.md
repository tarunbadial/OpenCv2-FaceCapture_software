# Face Recognition System

In this project my aim to detect the known and unknown peoples by camera and show in the window with name when he detect known people.

## Technology & Concept:

In this I am using the Opencv library for performing all operation. Tkinter libaray use for designed the user friendly  interface for get training data. In this project  i  used the opencv face recognition LBNF for training and prediction.

## System Requirements:

### Software / Libaraies:
* Python 3.7 [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Tkinter library for GUI download steps:
  * Open the terminal and run the pip3 install tkinter
* Opencv download steps:
  * You can be follow the this link:[Link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html)
* Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04

### Hardware Requirements:
* Ram 4GB
* Usb Camera 3.0
* Processor i3 

## How to run:
* Dauble click on the face capture .
