# Face Recognition System
In this project my aim to detect the known and unknown people by camera.

## Technology & Concept:
In this I am using the Opencv library for performing all operation. Tkinter libaray use for designed the user friendly  interface for get training data. In this project  i  used the opencv face recognition LBNF for training and prediction.

## System Requirements:
### Software / Libaraies:
• Python 3.7 [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
• Tkinter library for GUI download steps:
   ° Open the terminal and run the pip3 install tkinter
